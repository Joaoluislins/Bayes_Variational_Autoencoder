# Bayes Variational Autoencoder

The objective of this project is to study the implementation of Bayes variational autoencoders. In the case here I'm using a convolutional VAE to analyze the latent space of three different datasets and try to generate new samples that resemble the original features of the training examples.

Project made for a paper study at the MS in Machine Learning at Stevens Intitute of technology.
